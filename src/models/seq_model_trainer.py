TODO:
Implement a general shared interface for training all sequence models, you can still include multiple methods
The advanntage is that this makes training much more consistent across different models
You should consider RNN based models and Transformer based models. Both can be bidirectional or unidirectional.

Refactor methods from:
- models/transformer_utils.py
- models/rnn_seq_model.py
